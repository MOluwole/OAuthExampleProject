# OAuth Example Connecting Android to Meetup

## Overview

This repository contains sample of how an Android app can connect to the [Meetup API](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) using OAuth.

While creating my app [Met At](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metat.contacts) I found it fairly difficult to find a full working Android example which included the use of a callback URL.

If anyone has any trouble with the code or finds it unclear please let me know.
